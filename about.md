tool that allows you to easily get nongs by entering a link and replacement id, all while staying inside the game.

## NOTE: THIS MOD REQUIRED YOU HAVE FFMPEG INSTALED

Make sure you have [ffmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) downloaded and properly added to your system path varible. most of the versions should work, but I made this mod while using ffmpeg full build 6.0.


this mod works more links other than youtube, you can pretty much put any link that has media on it, including things like soundcloud or twitter, a list of supported sites can be found [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md).
